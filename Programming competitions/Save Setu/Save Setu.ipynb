    "beyond repair. No medicine is working on his body to ease his pain. It is urgent to operate on his\n",
    "left lung so that the disease doesn’t spread to his right lung. It can either be removed through surgery or transplanted. He comes from a modest family and it is difficult and impossible for them to bare his medical expenses anymore. Because of the money needed (12 million BDT) to transplant, it is his family’s decision to go with the surgery (3 million BDT). We must help them financially by raising\n",
