    "Once Ivan was asked to cut a pizza into seven pieces to distribute it among his friends. (Size of the pieces may not be the same. In fact, his piece will be larger than the others.) He thought a bit, and came to the conclusion that he can cut it into seven pieces by only three straight cuts through the pizza with a pizza knife. Accordingly, he cut the pizza in the following way (guess which one is Ivan’s piece):\n",

    "One of his friends, who never believed in Ivan’s smartness, was startled at this intelligence. He thought, if Ivan can do it, why can’t my computer? So he tried to do a similar (but not exactly as Ivan’s, for Ivan will criticize him for stealing his idea) job with his computer. He wrote a program that took the number of straight cuts one makes through the pizza, and output a number representing the\n",
    "maximum number of pizza pieces it will produce.\n",
